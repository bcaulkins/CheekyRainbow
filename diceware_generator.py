#This is version 0.1 of my DiceWare pass phrase generator.
#Use this to quickly generate a secure pass phrase using the DiceWare method shown here: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html
#Caution: It is recomended to use actual dice and not a digital tool to generate your diceware pass phrase.
#I wanted to see if I could write a program that would achive the same results as rolling dice. This was purely a learning exercise.
#Please use at your own risk
